# rock-paper-scissors
This is a python notebook for the classification task on Rock, Paper and Scissors data set from https://laurencemoroney.com/datasets.html. I have produced it for the purpose of learning as a part of the course "CNNs in TensorFlow" from DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The model uses CNN with 4 convolution layers, 4 max-pooling and dropout. This is a modified version of a notebook that was provided on the course.
